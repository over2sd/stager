Stager is a membership database frontend for community theaters.

Details:
Stager aims to be a free and viable option for community theaters wishing to maintain a database of actors, crew, and supporting members.

The program can store data about your actors and crew.
It includes a "face book" tab so directors not familiar with all of your actors can view photos of actors, filtered by age, and view information about each actor by clicking the photo.
It also includes a show tab, where you can view all the members involved in a particular production.

Feature requests and bug reports are welcome, as are contributors.
